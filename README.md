We are Jai Porwal and Vedant Rawal from TEAM KALIBER.
We have build an Smart Irrigation System for precise farming using IOT. This system mainly focuses on the efficient irrigation and helps farmers to reduce their labour and icrease their crop yield.
To monitor the weather, moisture level,animal detector  we  have used various type of sensors like ultrasonic sensor,proximity sensor,radiation sensor,soil  moisture sensorand microcontollers like arduino and raspberry pi3.
We had build a user friendly web for farmers which will help them to learn about our platform and to run them.We have also used chatbot and tutorials which will help to learn farmers about our web, For farmers convenience we have also used multilingual languages.
We have also build an arduino code which detects the soil moisture level and ON/OFF the motor accordingly.
